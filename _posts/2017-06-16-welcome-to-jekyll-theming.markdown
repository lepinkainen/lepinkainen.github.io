Testing Jekyll themes, whee!

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight go linenos %}
func createTestItem(url, createdTime, mediaType string) []Items { 
	// Slice to hold the media items
	items := []Items{}

	return items
}		 
{% endhighlight %}
